Hi, Iâ€™m a postdoc in the lab looking at spatial behaviours in rodents during open field exploration and goal-direction navigation task in virtual reality. More broadly, I am interested in how the brain forges meaningful representations of the physical world to guide meaningful actions in the world. I use techniques such as tetrode, silicon probe and NeuroPixel recording in mice with the aim of recording from many neurons at the same time to observe population-level neural codes.
