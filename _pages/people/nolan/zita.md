I am a joint PhD student in the Nolan lab and the [Osterweil lab](https://www.osterlab.org/), my research focuses on understanding the development of audiogenic (or sound-induced) seizures in the Fmr1 knockout mouse, which mimics the symptoms of patients with Fragile X Syndrome. High-intensity sound stimulation makes these mice experience tonic-clonic seizures, which has been linked with neuronal hyperactivation in the dorsal nucleus of their Inferior Colliculus, a major relay station for audiogenic information.

My project involves using RNA Seq and proteomic approaches, as well as imaging and patch clamp electrophysiology to identify the cell types of these hyperactivated neurons, as well as their recruitment dynamics and intracellular electrical properties that lead to audiogenic seizure. Ultimately, we want to asses the effectiveness of various drug and gene therapies on the observed neuronal hyperactivation and the behavioural manifestation of the seizures.
