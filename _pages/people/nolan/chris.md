I’m Chris Halcrow, a research software engingeer with a background in maths and physics. 
Generally, I’m interested in good software practices in science: openly publishing data, making sure that calculations are reproducible, and that code is transparent and easy to understand. 
In this lab, I focus on software called [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface) which implements “spike sorting”. 
This is where you take a recorded electrical signal from the brain and try and decipher when, and which, neurons have fired during the recording.
